All of the higher tier recipes now require you to use the Assembler:

[crafting{200,50,key=block/hydraulicAssembler}]













[prefix{l}]High Pressure vat [prefix{}]
[assembler{200,200,block/HPHydraulicPressureVat}]

[prefix{l}]High Pressure pump [prefix{}]
[assembler{200,320,block/HPHydraulicPump}]
