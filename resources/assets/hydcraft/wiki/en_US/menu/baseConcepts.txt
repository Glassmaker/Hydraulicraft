James 1-19 added Hydraulic's explanation, mostly copied form wikipedia, don't know if that's ok, will find out, also using MineMaarten's examples in pnumaticcraft}]

[prefix{l}Basics [prefix{}]
In HydrauliCraft you will need the following to get started, Iron, Copper, Lead, and Paper. These raw materials will
start you on a journey through Hydraulics. You'll start with a basic network of machines that can be used to generate power, crush ore's (doubling them), and smelt them. As your progress through the HydrauliCraft you will be able to farm crops, go deep sea diving,
 and teleport around your world. HydrauliCraft has 3 tiers that increase efficiency as you progress. This will all be
  explained later. Most all of the machines in HydrauliCraft are used to create the higher tier of the same machine. For example, a Low Pressure Pump is required to create a Medium Pressure Pump, so you don't have to worry about having machines that
  have no use when you start upgrading your network.

[prefix{l}Hydraulic Concepts [prefix{}]
[image{100,20,0.5,wiki.en_US/logo.png}]
Hydraulics is a topic of applied science and engineering dealing with the mechanical properties of liquids or fluids. At a very basic level it is a liquid version of pneumatics. Fluid mechanics provides the foundation for hydraulics, fluids can not be compressed so they are very good at transferring pressure or [prefix{o}]power [prefix{}]. Hydraulics can be used for the generation, control and transmission of [prefix{o}]power [prefix{}]through the use of pressurized liquids. Units of measure for HydrauliCraft are mB (milliBuckets) and Bar. You should be familiar with mB's 1000mB = 1 Bucket, and Bar is a measurement of pressure. So for example, the air pressure at sea level is equal to about 1 Bar, which is equal to roughly 14 pounds per square inch. Fluid [prefix{o}viscosity [prefix{}] (how "thick" a fluid is) plays a part as well. Thin fluids like water are harder to seal and tend to [prefix{o}]"squeeze" [prefix{}]between surfaces
 especial when it's under pressure thus it tends to leak out of a system. Were as Hydraulic Oil is much thicker and won't leak like the thinner fluids so it's easier to seal when it's under pressure. Making it possible to get much higher pressures without
 fluid loss. Remember in Hydraulics pressure is [prefix{lo}]Power [prefix{}] and higher pressure means more efficient
  and faster machines.

[comment{Add links to how the assembler and filter work.
James 1-19 added links and brief explaition, I would like to add images of the machines, need to find out were they
are...}]
You will need the following machines to build the higher tier machines.
