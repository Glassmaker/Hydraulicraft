[prefix{l}]Basics [prefix{}]
In Hydraulicraft you will need the following to get started, Iron, Copper, Lead, and Paper. These raw materials will start you on a journey through Hydraulics.
You'll start with a basic network of machines that can be used to generate power, crush ore's (doubling them), and smelt them. As you progress through Hydraulicraft you will be able to farm crops, go deep sea diving, and teleport around your world. 
Hydraulicraft has 3 tiers that increase efficiency as you progress. This will all be explained later. Most all of the machines in Hydraulicraft are used to create the higher tier of the same machine. For example, a Low Pressure Pump is required to create a Medium Pressure Pump, so you don't have to worry about having machines that have no use when you start upgrading your network.

[prefix{l}]Hydraulic Concepts [prefix{}]

Hydraulics is a topic of applied science and engineering dealing with the mechanical properties of liquids or fluids. At a very basic level it is a liquid version of pneumatics. Fluid mechanics provides the foundation for hydraulics, fluids cannot be compressed so they are very good at transferring pressure or [prefix{o}]power [prefix{}]. Hydraulics can be used for the generation, control and transmission of [prefix{o}]power [prefix{}]through the use of pressurized liquids. Units of measure for Hydraulicraft are mB (milliBuckets) and Bar. You should be familiar with mB's 1000mB = 1 Bucket, and Bar is a measurement of pressure. So for example, the air pressure at sea level is equal to about 1 Bar, which is equal to roughly 14 pounds per square inch. Fluid [prefix{o}]viscosity [prefix{}] (how "thick" a fluid is) plays a part as well. Thin fluids like water are harder to seal and tend to [prefix{o}]"squeeze" [prefix{}]between surfaces especially when it's under pressure. It tends to leak out of a system. Whereas Hydraulic Oil is much thicker and won't leak like water, so it's easier to seal when it's under pressure, Making it possible to get much higher pressures without fluid loss. Remember that in Hydraulics pressure is [prefix{lo}]Power [prefix{}] and higher pressure means more efficient and faster machines.
