James 1-19 added Hydraulic's explanation, mostly copied form wikipedia, don't know if that's ok, will find out, also using MineMaarten's examples in pnumaticcraft}]

[prefix{l}Basics [prefix{}]
In HydrauliCraft you will need the following to get started, Iron, Copper, Lead, and Paper. These raw materials will start you on a journey through Hydraulics. You'll start with a basic network of machines that can be used to generate power, crush ore's (doubling them), and smelt them. HydrauliCraft has 3 tiers that increase efficency as you progress. This will all be explained later.

[prefix{l}Hydraulic Concepts [prefix{}]
[image{100,20,0.25,wiki.en_US/logo.png}]
Hydraulics is a topic of applied science and engineering dealing with the mechanical properties of liquids or fluids. At a very basic level it is a liquid version of pneumatics. Fluid mechanics provides the foundation for hydraulics, fluids can not be compressed so they are very good at transferring pressure or [prefix{0}]power [prefix{}]. Hydraulics can be used for the generation, control and transmission of [prefix{o}]power [prefix{}]through the use of pressurized liquids. Units of measure for HydrauliCraft are mB (milliBuckets) and Bar. You should be familiar with mB's 1000mB = 1 Bucket, and Bar is a measurement of pressure. So for example, the air pressure at sea level is equal to about 1 Bar, which is equal to roughly 14 pounds per square inch.

[comment{And links to how the assembler and filter work.
James 1-19 added links and brief explaition, I would like ot add images of the machines, need to find out were they are...}]
You will need the following machines to build the higher tier machines.
