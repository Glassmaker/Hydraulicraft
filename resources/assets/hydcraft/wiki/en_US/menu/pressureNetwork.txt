[prefix{l}]Pressure Network [prefix{}]
Here is an example of a basic entry level network, a low pressure reservoir on the left, a low pressure pump in the center, and in this case an induction incinerator to the right. And of course some pipes to connect them all together.
The Reservoir is for storing and inputting your fluid's into the network. The Pump to provide pressure to the network. And a machine to put your fluid and pressure to work, in this example an Induction Incinerator to smelt Ore.

[prefix{l}]Tiers [prefix{}]
There are 3 tiers in Hydraulicraft
- LP for Low Pressure
- MP for Medium Pressure
- HP for High Pressure
Higher pressure machines will process faster than lower pressure machines. Note! Trying to put more pressure into anything that isn't rated for it is a very bad idea, it will result in an explosion! So be careful! For example putting a medium pressure through a low pressure pipe will burst the pipe, and if it's a machine the machine will explode. It may not happen instantly, however when the pressure in the system reaches the limit of the pipe/machine it will burst, resulting in the loss of the item and it's contents.

[prefix{l}]Starting out [prefix{}]
Your basic network will run on water, it'll leak and you'll need to continuously resupply your network. This can be achieved with the [link{hydcraft:block/hydArchemedes}]Hydraulic Archemedes Screw [link{}]. Place it next to an infinite water supply to keep your system filled. You'll want to move to [link{hydcraft:menu/oil}]Hydraulic Oil [link{}]As soon as possible. It can run much higher pressures and doesn't leak. When you setup your network remember that all of the pipes and machines will require some amount of fluid to fill their [prefix{o}]internal buffers [prefix{}] or more precisely reservoirs.
