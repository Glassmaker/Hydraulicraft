[prefix{o}]Hydraulic Oil [prefix{}]is used to run your network and is better than water, as it won't leak, and therefore can run at much higher pressures.

[prefix{o}]Lubricant [prefix{}]is used in the [link{hydcraft:block/hydAssembler}]Hydraulic Assembler [link{}] for different recipes

[prefix{o}]Perfluorocarbon Fluid [prefix{}]is a breathable liquid (yes, it's a real thing!)used to help you breath at extreme depths of the ocean. 8 buckets of the fluid in a [link{hydcraft:menu/diving}]Diving Suit [link{}] will allow you to breathe under water for about 6 minutes.
