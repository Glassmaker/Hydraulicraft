[prefix{l}]Oil [prefix{}] can be found on the surface, look for an Oil Spout!

Crude Oil is used to create the other fluids needed in HydrauliCraft, they are Hydraulic Oil, Lubricant, Fluoro Carbon Fluid, and foxium/fluid...
This is achived by use of the [link{hydcraft:block/hydFilter}]Hydraulic Filter[link{}]
Hydraulic Oil is used to run your network and is better than water, as it won't leak, and therefore can run at much higher pressures.
Lubricant is used in the [link{hydcraft:block/hydAssembler}]Hydraulic Assembler [link{}]
Perfluorocarbon Fluid is a breathable liquid (yes, it's a real thing!)used to help you breath at extreme depths of the
ocean. 8 buckets of the fluid in the [link{hydcraft:menu/diving}]Diving Suit [link{}] will allow you to breath under
water for about 6 minutes.
Foxium/fluid is used for ???
