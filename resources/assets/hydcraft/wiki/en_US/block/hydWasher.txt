[comment{James 7-20 Added, explain how to build it and what it does, maybe show recipes or images and list the
recipes{]

The Washer is a multi-block machine used to refine [link{hydcraft:menu/minerals]}Minerals [link{}] so they can be
used as filter media. It is also used to process ore chunks into dusts thus increasing ore yields. The maximum pressure
 it can use is based on the core used when building the structure. So you can start with a low pressure core, and
 then just upgrade the core to a higher tier to run at higher pressures. You will need the following blocks to build a
Washer. 1 Interface Valve, 1 Hydraulic Block Valve, 1 Washer, 1 Core (low, medium, or high) and 23 Pressure Walls.
The structure is a 3x3x3, and the bottom layer consists of a 3x3 with the Valve Interface block on an edge, and the
Hydraulic Block Valve on an edge, the rest of the layer is Pressure Walls. The second layer is a Core in the center,
and the Washer on an edge, the balance is Pressure Walls, The top row is all Pressure Walls. If you have done it
properly a multi-block structure will form and you can open the UI by right clicking on the washer block.
